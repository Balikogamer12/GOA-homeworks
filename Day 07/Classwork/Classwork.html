<h1>Rugby union</h1>
<p>Rugby union football, commonly known simply as rugby union in English-speaking countries
    and rugby 15/XV in non-Anglophone Europe, or often just rugby, is a close-contact team
    sport that originated at Rugby School in England in the first half of the 19th century.
    Rugby is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is
    played between two teams of 15 players each, using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular 
    field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Primitive forms of football included harpastum, played by the Romans,
    where two opposing teams competed to throw a large ball into an 
    opposition net, fighting for possession of the ball. Medieval Irishmen
    played caid, carrying an inflated bladder and using arched trees as goals.
    The Welsh played an inter-parish game using a wooden ball called cnapan.
    Frenchmen played soule and Georgians played lelo. "Football" as a game was well
    established by 1803 at Rugby School and by the 1830s, "running in" with the ball 
    in hand was allowed but subject to hacking and "collaring".[9]</p>

    <h3>Former Rugby School</h3> 
    <p>student Albert Pell is credited 
    with having formed the first "football" team while
    a student at Cambridge University.</p>

    <h4>First internationals</h4>
    <p>The first rugby football international was played on 27 March 1871 between Scotland and England in Edinburgh.
    Scotland won the game by one goal and one try to one goal.[15][19] By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative
    teams and in 1883 the first international competition, the Home Nations Championship had begun. 1883 is also the 
    year of the first rugby sevens tournament, the Melrose Sevens,[20] which is still held annually.</p>
