<h2>Rugby is a fast-paced, contact sport played with an oval-shaped ball. It originated in England in the 19th century and has grown into a popular sport worldwide. There are two main types: Rugby Union (15 players per team) and Rugby League (13 players per team)</h2>

<h3>The objective is to score points by carrying or kicking the ball over the opponent's goal line. Key actions include running, passing, tackling, and scrummaging. Rugby is known for its physicality,aa teamwork, and strategy, with major international competitions like the Rugby World Cup and Six Nations Championship.</h3>

<h3>Rugby "გარდასახვა" (Transformation) refers to the process that occurs after a team scores a try. In rugby, when a team crosses the opponent’s try line and places the ball on the ground in the in-goal area, they score a try (5 points). However, they are given the opportunity to score additional points through a conversion kick.</h3>

<h3>Scrum</h3>

<h3>A scrum is one of the most important and physical elements of rugby, used to restart the game when the ball is not in play or if there has been a minor infringement.</h3>

<h2>How a Scrum Works:</h2>

<h3>Formation: In a rugby union match, each team has 8 players who participate in the scrum. These 8 players form two rows: the front row (consisting of two props) and the back row (consisting of two locks). The players bind together, with their heads down and their bodies pressed against each other.

    The Ball: The scrum half (or halfback) of the team puts the ball into the tunnel formed between the two front rows of the scrum. The teams then compete to "hook" the ball with their feet and win possession.
    
    The Battle: The two teams push against each other with maximum force to gain an advantage. The team that wins the scrum is usually able to control the ball and continue attacking or passing it to the backs.</h3>
